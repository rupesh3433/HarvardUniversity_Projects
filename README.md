# Harvard University Projects

Welcome to my repository for the Harvard University projects completed as part of the CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course!

## Week 0 - Scratch Game

### Spacecraft Game
- **Description:** This project is a simple spacecraft game created using Scratch. Navigate the spacecraft through space, avoiding obstacles and collecting points.

### Readability
- **Description:** Implement a program that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text.
- **File:** [readability.c](week2-c-project/readability/readability.c)

### Scrabble
- **Description:** Implement a program that calculates the score of a given word in Scrabble.
- **File:** [scrabble.c](week2-c-project/scrabble/scrabble.c)

### Substitution Cipher
- **Description:** Implement a program that encrypts messages using a substitution cipher.
- **File:** [substitution.c](week2-c-project/substitution/substitution.c)

## Week 3 - Sorting Algorithms Analysis

### Sorting Algorithms Analysis
- **Description:**
   ->In this project, I conducted an analysis of three different sorting algorithms: selection sort, bubble sort, and merge sort by examining the behavior of three compiled C programs (sort1, sort2, sort3) on various input datasets.

   ->After downloading and extracting the provided distribution code, I ran each sorting program on different types of input files (e.g., sorted, reversed, random) to observe their performance characteristics.

   ->Through this analysis, I determined that sort1 implements bubble sort, identified by its quadratic time complexity and slower performance on reversed input.

   ->sort2 was identified as merge sort due to its efficient O(n log n) performance across all input types.

   ->Lastly, sort3 exhibited the characteristics of selection sort, showing inefficiency (O(n^2)) and slowdown with larger datasets or reversed lists.
